        <p>Egg tarts are a very famous Chinese dessert, but can also be found in many other countries around the world like Portugal and Brazil. All the dessert is just a pastry crust with an egg custard filling that is then just baked. Egg tarts most likely started out in the city of GuangZhou in China drawing inspiration from the European custard tart. And over time it's become a big hit.</p>

      <p> Panna cotta is an Italian dessert of sweetened cream thickened with gelatin and molded. The cream may be aromatized with coffee, vanilla, or other flavorings. The name panna cotta is not mentioned in Italian cookbooks before the 1960s,yet it is often cited as a traditional dessert of the northern Italian region of Piedmont.An 1879 dictionary mentions a dish called latte inglese 'English milk', made of cream cooked with gelatin and molded,though other sources say that latte inglese is made with egg yolks, like cr√®me anglaise; perhaps the name covered any thickened custard-like preparation.</p>
