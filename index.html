    <p>Egg tarts are a very famous Chinese dessert, but can also be found in many other countries around the world like Portugal and Brazil. All the dessert is just a pastry crust with an egg custard filling that is then just baked. Egg tarts most likely started out in the city of GuangZhou in China drawing inspiration from the European custard tart. And over time it's become a big hit.
